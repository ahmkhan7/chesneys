In NodeBlok, shapes will fall out of each block at the top of the screen and follow the path. 
Your job is to change the path so that the shapes get to the matching block at the bottom of the screen. 
You can change the path that the shapes follow using nodes. 
Nodes are connected to two or more parts of the path and point towards the part of the path that shapes will follow. 
You can click on a node to change which way it is pointing.
